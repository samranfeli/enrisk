                    The concept of risk analysis and decision making for economic, financial, and engineering applications has become widely accepted in the oil and gas industry. However, the actual use of decision analysis and risk assessment tools have remained limited, due mostly to complexity of such methods. Another reason is that the professional use of such decision analysis and risk assessment tools and methods requires advanced knowledge of decision, utility, and risk analysis theory so that they can be integrated into petroleum economic, financial, and engineering applications.
